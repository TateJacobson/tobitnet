# Penalized Tobit Regression

The `tobitnet` package provides methods for fitting penalized Tobit models: 

- `tobitnet` fits the Tobit model with a weighted elastic net penalty using generalized coordinate descent
- `tobitscad` fits the Tobit model with a SCAD penalty using a local linear approximation algorithm 

See Jacobson and Zou (2022) for details.
